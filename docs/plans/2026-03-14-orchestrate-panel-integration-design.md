# Orchestrate-Panel Integration Design

## Problem

Brainstorming (`superpowers:brainstorming`) hardcodes "invoke writing-plans" as its terminal state. When orchestrate calls brainstorming in the DEFINE phase, it chains directly into writing-plans — skipping the panel and preventing orchestrate from regaining control for subsequent phases (DEVELOP, DELIVER).

Additionally, writing-plans presents execution handoff options that conflict with orchestrate's DEVELOP phase, which should own the execution choice.

Model selections are hardcoded across skills (haiku for panel/reviews, sonnet for implementers). These should be configurable per-phase via `orchestrate.conf`.

## Solution

Integrate the panel into brainstorming as an enrichment step. Make both brainstorming and writing-plans orchestrate-aware via an explicit `--from-orchestrate` flag so they return control when called from orchestrate. Replace hardcoded model references with configurable per-phase model settings.

### Orchestrate Context Detection

Both skills accept a `--from-orchestrate` flag in their `{ARGS}`. Orchestrate passes this flag when invoking them. When present, skills STOP at their natural boundary instead of chaining to the next skill — returning control to orchestrate.

- **Flag present:** Return control to orchestrate (do not chain to next skill).
- **Flag absent:** Standalone use — chain as today.

The event log (`.claude/orchestrate-events.log`) remains for audit/debugging but does not drive control flow.

### Model Configuration

Per-phase model settings in `orchestrate.conf`. All phases default to `"default"` (inherit session model). Only overrides need to be specified. DEVELOP has a nested split for standard vs. lite roles.

```hcl
models {
  # discover = "sonnet"
  # define   = "sonnet"
  # deliver  = "sonnet"

  develop {
    # standard = "sonnet"
    lite = "sonnet"
  }
}
```

- `"default"` = inherit the session's model (explicit way to say "use parent model")
- Omitted key = same as `"default"`
- Only `develop.lite` has a non-default value out of the box

**Model mapping:**

| Config key | Roles | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `models.discover` | All DISCOVER subagents | `"default"` |
| `models.define` | Panel advocates, brainstorming subagents | `"default"` |
| `models.develop.standard` | Implementers, tier-2 review, ralph orchestrator | `"default"` |
| `models.develop.lite` | Tier-1 review (quick pass) | `"sonnet"` |
| `models.deliver` | Drift analysis, docs review | `"default"` |

Skills read `orchestrate.conf` if it exists, fall back to defaults if not. Standalone use (no config file) works with defaults.

## Changes

### 1. Brainstorming Patch

**Panel enrichment (after step 3 — propose approaches):**

- Parse `{ARGS}` for `--skip-panel` and `--from-orchestrate`.
- If `--skip-panel` is not set: check if external providers are available (codex MCP tool exists, gemini on PATH).
- If providers available: invoke `fiddle:panel` with the proposed approaches. Present panel commentary (consensus, disagreements, tradeoffs) alongside the approaches when asking the user to pick.
- If `--skip-panel` is set or no providers available: skip, continue as today.

**Orchestrate-aware terminal state (after step 5 — write design doc):**

- If `--from-orchestrate` is set: STOP. Do not invoke writing-plans. Control returns to orchestrate.
- If absent: invoke writing-plans as today.

### 2. Writing-Plans Patch Update

**Orchestrate-aware handoff (after bean creation):**

- Parse `{ARGS}` for `--from-orchestrate`.
- If `--from-orchestrate` is set: STOP after bean creation. No handoff prompt. Control returns to orchestrate.
- If absent: present handoff options as today (Subagent-Driven, Parallel Session, Beans Batch, Ralph Beans).

Bean creation section is unchanged.

### 3. Orchestrate DEFINE Phase

Simplified from 5 steps to 4:

1. **Brainstorming** — `Skill(skill: "superpowers:brainstorming", args: "--from-orchestrate")`. Includes panel enrichment internally. Returns control after design doc.
2. **Implementation Planning** — `Skill(skill: "superpowers:writing-plans", args: "--from-orchestrate")`. Produces plan + beans. Returns control after bean creation.
3. **Capture Epic ID** — `beans list --json -t epic -s todo`. Unchanged.
4. **Transition** — Log event, fall through to DEVELOP. Unchanged.

Old Step 2 (separate panel invocation) removed.

### 4. Orchestrate DEVELOP Phase

New Step 0 before spawning ralph:

**Execution choice** — check `orchestrate.conf` for a `develop.execution` setting. If set, use it. If not set, present options to the user:

- **Ralph Subs (background subagent)** — spawn `develop-subs` as background Agent in this session. Automated implement/review cycles.
- **Tmux Team (conductor agent)** — launch parallel workers in tmux panes via conductor.
- **Hands-on (this session)** — use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`. Fresh subagent per task with code review between tasks. Interactive with human checkpoints.
- **Hands-on (parallel session)** — open new session with `superpowers:executing-plans`. Batch execution with checkpoints.

Config override example in `orchestrate.conf`:
```hcl
develop {
  execution = "develop-subs"  // or "tmux-team" or "hands-on"
}
```

Execute based on choice. Remaining DEVELOP steps (holistic review, transition) unchanged.

### 5. Configurable Model Settings

Replace all 12 hardcoded model references across skills with config-driven values:

- **Orchestrate** — ralph spawn uses `models.develop.standard`
- **Panel** — position advocates use `models.define`
- **develop-subs** — implementers use `models.develop.standard`, tier-1 review uses `models.develop.lite`, tier-2 review uses `models.develop.standard`
- **develop-team** — same as develop-subs

Each skill reads `orchestrate.conf` if present, falls back to defaults. The `"default"` keyword means inherit the session model.

### 6. Patch-Superpowers Skill Update

- Update overview: "Patches three cached skills: `writing-plans`, `executing-plans`, and `brainstorming`."
- Add brainstorming patch step (panel enrichment + `--from-orchestrate` terminal state).
- Update writing-plans patch to include `--from-orchestrate` handoff after bean creation.
- Executing-plans patch unchanged.

## Flow Diagrams

### Standalone brainstorming

```
explore → questions → propose approaches → [panel enrichment] →
present with commentary → user picks → design → design doc → writing-plans
```

### From orchestrate

```
DEFINE:
  brainstorming --from-orchestrate (explore → questions → approaches → [panel] → user picks → design → doc → STOP)
  → writing-plans --from-orchestrate (plan → beans → STOP)
  → capture epic → transition

DEVELOP:
  execution choice (config or interactive: develop-subs | tmux team | hands-on)
  → execute (models from config) → holistic review → transition

DELIVER:
  drift analysis → docs-evolve → close epic
```

## Panel Debate Outcomes

Design reviewed via adversarial panel (2026-03-14). Key changes from debate:

- **Event log → explicit flags:** Replaced `.claude/orchestrate-events.log` detection with `--from-orchestrate` flag for terminal state control. Flags are visible at call sites, eliminate stale-log and crash-state risks. Event log retained for audit only.
- **Config-default for execution:** DEVELOP execution choice reads `orchestrate.conf` first, falls back to interactive prompt.
- **Configurable models:** Per-phase model config replaces hardcoded model references. Only `develop.lite = "sonnet"` differs from default (session model).
- **Backlog items:** Patch versioning/detection for cached skills, nested orchestrate guard.
