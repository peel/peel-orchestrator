# Backlog

<!-- Ideas, technical debt, someday/maybe items. Cross-cutting — covers both
     product and technical concerns. Append-only with dates.
     
     Periodically review: promote to beans, delete, or leave.
     Agents can suggest additions here during brainstorming.
     Agents should read this before planning to avoid re-discovering known items. -->

### 2026-03-15 — Update orchestrate/SKILL.md config example to show full provider structure
The config example in orchestrate/SKILL.md only shows phase arrays and ralph block — it omits the codex/gemini CLI definitions and timeout block added in the async provider coordination epic. Agents reading only the example won't see the full config shape.

### 2026-03-15 — Document AGENTS.md symlink setup in README
SYSTEM.md notes the AGENTS.md symlink for shared provider context, but README is more discoverable for new users. Add setup instructions there.

### 2026-03-15 — Clarify provider-context.md path resolution in panel/SKILL.md
The dispatch procedure references `roles/provider-context.md` by relative path. orchestrate/SKILL.md resolves both paths explicitly, but panel/SKILL.md only references the dispatch procedure without explicitly mentioning the template. Adding the explicit reference would improve clarity.
