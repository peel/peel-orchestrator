# Backlog

<!-- Ideas, technical debt, someday/maybe items. Cross-cutting — covers both
     product and technical concerns. Append-only with dates.
     
     Periodically review: promote to beans, delete, or leave.
     Agents can suggest additions here during brainstorming.
     Agents should read this before planning to avoid re-discovering known items. -->

<!-- ### YYYY-MM-DD — Title
     Description of the idea or debt item.

### 2026-04-02 — Skill size estimates are unreliable for verbatim extraction
Design spec predicted 12KB for develop-loop; actual was 20.5KB (71% over). JSON examples, code blocks, and HARD-GATE blocks are denser than prose and harder to estimate. Future specs involving skill extraction should measure the source line range directly rather than estimating.
Origin: implementation (develop modularization epic fiddle-wdg0)
