# Fiddle

Claude Code plugin for orchestrating a four-phase development lifecycle with a calibrated evaluator loop and multi-model support.

## Orchestrate

`/fiddle:orchestrate <topic>` chains four phases. Each phase is also a standalone skill.

**DISCOVER** [`/fiddle:discover`](skills/discover/SKILL.md) — Scan project docs, research the ecosystem via external providers (Claude + Codex), and challenge scope assumptions until every branch is resolved.

**DEFINE** [`/fiddle:define`](skills/define/SKILL.md) — Brainstorm approaches, run a multi-model adversarial panel (Claude + Codex + Gemini), challenge the chosen design, then produce an implementation plan with sized beans.

**DEVELOP** [`/fiddle:develop`](skills/develop/SKILL.md) — Execute beans via the evaluator loop: dispatch implementer → dispatch per-domain, per-provider evaluators → check thresholds → converge or iterate. Multi-domain evaluation with holistic cross-domain review when all tasks complete.

**DELIVER** [`/fiddle:deliver`](skills/deliver/SKILL.md) — Drift analysis via external providers (Claude + Codex), evaluator evolve step (calibration updates, antipattern capture, threshold tuning), update technical docs, close the epic.

> [!NOTE]
> Any CLI that accepts a prompt on stdin works as a provider (Codex, Gemini, Copilot, etc). Configure per phase in [`orchestrate.json`](orchestrate.json).

## Evaluator Loop

The develop phase uses a calibrated evaluator loop: dispatch implementer → dispatch evaluators → check thresholds → converge or iterate. Script-enforced convergence (two consecutive passes required) with a dispatch budget that prevents infinite iteration.

**Per-domain evaluation.** Tasks spanning multiple domains (frontend + backend) get independent per-domain scoring. `resolve-domains.sh` maps task domains to evaluator templates. Domain-specific templates (frontend, backend) replace the general template for typed projects.

**Runtime verification.** Evaluators launch and interact with the running app via project-configured MCP tools (marionette, curl, go-dev-mcp) to gather evidence beyond static code review.

**Multi-provider scoring.** Multiple LLM providers evaluate each task for diversity of judgment. Conservative scoring (min across providers per dimension). Disagreements (spread >= 3) surfaced in eval logs.

**Holistic review.** After all tasks complete, a cross-domain integration review produces a spec coverage matrix and remediation loop for any gaps.

**Calibration + evolve.** Attended mode shows scorecards to humans before acting — corrections become calibration anchors in project-specific files. Antipattern files loaded by implementer and evaluator. The deliver evolve step encodes improvements for future runs.

## Configuration

Orchestrate reads [`orchestrate.json`](orchestrate.json) from the project root. All keys optional — defaults apply when omitted. See [`fiddle:orchestrate`](skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md) for the full reference.

```jsonc
{
  "providers": {
    "codex": { "command": "codex exec", "flags": "--json -s read-only" },
    "gemini": { "command": "gemini", "flags": "-o json --approval-mode auto_edit" },
    "phases": { "discover": ["codex"], "define": ["codex", "gemini"], ... }
  },
  "evaluators": {
    "attended": false,
    "max_dispatches_per_task": 10,
    "domains": {
      "general": {
        "template": "evaluator-general",
        "providers": ["claude"],
        "calibration": "docs/evaluator-calibration-general.md",
        "antipatterns": "docs/antipatterns-general.md"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Install

```bash
# fiddle — from marketplace
/plugin marketplace add github:peel/peel-marketplace
/plugin install fiddle

# fiddle — from source
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/fiddle
```

Providers are auto-detected on session start.

### Optional: Clash (conflict detection)

When running parallel workers in worktrees, fiddle includes a PreToolUse hook that warns agents before writing to files that conflict with another worktree. This requires [clash](https://github.com/clash-sh/clash):

```bash
# via cargo
cargo install clash-sh

# via nix
nix profile install github:clash-sh/clash
```

The hook is advisory (never blocks) and silently skips if clash is not installed.
