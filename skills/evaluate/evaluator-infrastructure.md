# Infrastructure Domain Evaluator Template

For terraform, kubernetes, helm, nix, and docker infrastructure tasks. Evaluates correctness, idempotency, security posture, drift resistance, and spec fidelity via dry-run validation.

## Verification Approach

No live runtime. The evaluator runs dry-run validation commands based on files changed in the diff.

### Validation Commands

- **Terraform:** `terraform validate`, `terraform plan`
- **Kubernetes/Helm:** `helm template` + `kubectl apply --dry-run=client`, check for deprecated APIs
- **Nix:** `nix flake check`, `nix build --dry-run`
- **Docker:** `docker build`, `docker compose config`

Multiple tools may apply per task. Pick based on files in the diff.

### Evidence Gathering

- Run validation/plan commands for each tool detected
- Check for unexpected resource destroys or recreates
- Verify no hardcoded secrets in config
- Check for deprecated APIs or features
- Test idempotency where possible (plan shows no changes on reapply)
- Record which tools were run and their outcomes

### What to Check

- Do all configs validate without errors?
- Does the plan show only intended changes?
- Are secrets properly externalized?
- Are resource lifecycle rules appropriate?
- Are deprecated features or APIs avoided?
- Is state management configured correctly?

## Dimensions

### Correctness

**Default threshold: 7**

```
 1  Broken: Doesn't parse. Syntax errors, missing required fields.
 2  References broken: Parses but references undefined resources,
    variables, or modules.
 3  Type errors: References resolve but types mismatch. Wrong
    argument types, invalid attribute access.
 4  Plan fails: Validates locally but plan/dry-run fails against
    provider or cluster. Missing providers, auth issues.
 5  Partial plan: Some resources plan cleanly, others error.
    Mixed state.
 6  Plans clean: All resources plan without error. Some warnings
    (deprecated features, provider suggestions).
 7  Clean plan, expected changes: Plan shows only intended changes.
    No unexpected destroys or recreates. Warnings addressed.
 8  Robust: Handles variable inputs gracefully. Conditional
    resources work for all configurations. Cross-module
    references correct.
 9  Thorough: All variable combinations validated. Outputs
    verified. Module interfaces well-typed.
10  Bulletproof: Adversarial inputs handled. Plan is clean
    across all target environments.
```

### Idempotency

**Default threshold: 7**

```
 1  Destructive: Every apply recreates resources. Data loss
    on reapply.
 2  Unstable: Most resources recreated on reapply. Force-new
    triggers everywhere.
 3  Partial stability: Some resources stable, others recreate
    due to missing lifecycle rules or volatile inputs.
 4  Name-dependent: Resources stable only with specific naming.
    Random suffixes or timestamps cause recreate.
 5  Mostly stable: Second apply shows minor changes (tag updates,
    metadata) but no recreates.
 6  Stable: Second apply shows no changes for core resources.
    Some data sources re-read.
 7  Idempotent: Second apply is a clean no-op. Lifecycle rules
    prevent unnecessary recreates. Ignore-changes where
    appropriate.
 8  Resilient: Handles external drift gracefully. Import-friendly
    resource definitions.
 9  Convergent: Repeated applies converge even from partially-
    applied state. Recovery from interrupted applies.
10  Self-healing: Detects and corrects drift automatically. State
    is always convergent regardless of starting point.
```

### Security Posture

**Default threshold: 7**

```
 1  Secrets in code: Passwords, tokens, or keys hardcoded in
    config files.
 2  Wide open: 0.0.0.0/0 ingress, * IAM permissions, privileged
    containers, root users.
 3  Default insecure: Using provider defaults that are insecure
    (public buckets, unencrypted storage, default passwords).
 4  Partially locked: Some resources secured, others use overly
    broad permissions. Mix of secure and insecure patterns.
 5  Functional security: No hardcoded secrets. Basic network
    restrictions. IAM roles exist but are broader than needed.
 6  Reasonable: Secrets from vault/SSM/sealed-secrets. Network
    policies restrict traffic. IAM scoped to service level.
 7  Solid: Least privilege IAM. Network segmentation. Encryption
    at rest and in transit. No privileged containers. Non-root.
 8  Hardened: Pod security standards enforced. Resource quotas
    set. Audit logging enabled. Secret rotation configured.
 9  Defense in depth: Multiple security layers. Network policies
    + service mesh. RBAC + OPA/admission controllers.
10  Zero trust: Every component authenticated and authorized. All
    traffic encrypted and verified. Immutable infrastructure.
```

### Drift Resistance

**Default threshold: 6**

```
 1  No state: Local state files, no backend. State will be lost.
 2  Fragile state: Remote backend but no locking. Concurrent
    applies will corrupt state.
 3  Manual dependencies: Resources depend on manually-created
    prerequisites not in code.
 4  Partial coverage: Some resources in code, others created
    manually alongside. Mixed management.
 5  Managed but brittle: All resources in code. State locked.
    But no drift detection or lifecycle rules.
 6  Drift-aware: Lifecycle rules prevent accidental recreates.
    Ignore-changes for externally-managed fields. State backend
    with locking.
 7  Drift-resistant: All resources fully managed. External
    dependencies declared as data sources. State is the source
    of truth.
 8  Drift-detected: Plan runs in CI catch drift. Externally-
    modified resources flagged.
 9  Drift-corrected: Automated remediation for common drift
    patterns. State refresh integrated into workflow.
10  Immutable: Infrastructure replaced, not mutated. Drift is
    impossible by design.
```

### Domain Spec Fidelity

**Default threshold: 8**

```
 1  Wrong feature: Built something entirely different from task spec.
 2  Wrong approach: Right feature, fundamentally wrong implementation
    strategy.
 3  Major gaps: Core task requirements missing. What exists may be
    correct but the task is incomplete.
 4  Partial: ~50% of task requirements implemented. Missing pieces
    noticeable.
 5  Most there: ~70% of task requirements. Missing pieces are secondary
    but a careful reviewer would catch them.
 6  Functional coverage: All primary task requirements met. Secondary
    requirements partially covered.
 7  Good coverage: All task requirements met. Some implemented minimally
    (letter of the spec, not spirit).
 8  Faithful: Implementation matches task spec in both letter and spirit.
    Design intent preserved.
 9  Complete: Every task requirement fully implemented. No drift.
    Implementation captures nuances of the task description.
10  Exceeds spec: All requirements met and implementation improves on
    spec where the task description was ambiguous or underspecified.
