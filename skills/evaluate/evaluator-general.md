# General Domain Evaluator Template

For tasks that don't fit a specific domain (scripts, configuration, tooling).

## Dimensions

### Correctness

Does the code produce right results for all inputs?

**Default threshold: 7**

```
 1  Broken: Doesn't compile or start. Panics on launch.
 2  Crashes: Starts but crashes on basic operations. Core paths broken.
 3  Happy path only: Main flow works, all error paths crash or
    return wrong data.
 4  Fragile: Works for expected inputs. Unexpected inputs cause
    silent corruption, panics, or wrong results.
 5  Partial: Most paths handled. Some edge cases produce wrong
    results. Error messages misleading.
 6  Functional: All specified paths work correctly. Edge cases
    handled but some return generic errors.
 7  Solid: All paths correct with appropriate errors. Input
    validation present. No silent failures.
 8  Robust: Handles unexpected inputs gracefully. Errors are
    specific and actionable. Concurrent access safe.
 9  Thorough: All edge cases handled correctly. Error recovery
    works. Observability (logging, metrics) in place.
10  Bulletproof: Handles adversarial input. Graceful degradation
    under load. Comprehensive observability.
```

### Domain Spec Fidelity

Does this task's implementation match the task-level spec?

**Default threshold: 8**

```
 1  Wrong feature: Built something entirely different from task spec.
 2  Wrong approach: Right feature, fundamentally wrong implementation strategy.
 3  Major gaps: Core task requirements missing. What exists may be correct
    but the task is incomplete.
 4  Partial: ~50% of task requirements implemented. Missing pieces noticeable.
 5  Most there: ~70% of task requirements. Missing pieces are secondary
    but a careful reviewer would catch them.
 6  Functional coverage: All primary task requirements met. Secondary requirements
    (edge cases, error states, responsive behavior) partially covered.
 7  Good coverage: All task requirements met. Some implemented minimally
    (letter of the spec, not spirit).
 8  Faithful: Implementation matches task spec in both letter and spirit.
    Design intent preserved.
 9  Complete: Every task requirement fully implemented. No drift.
    Implementation captures nuances of the task description.
10  Exceeds spec: All requirements met and implementation improves on
    spec where the task description was ambiguous or underspecified.
```

### Code Quality

Is the code clean, maintainable, and idiomatic?

**Default threshold: 6**

```
 1  Broken: Syntax errors, doesn't parse.
 2  Garbage: Runs but incomprehensible. No structure, no naming,
    no separation of concerns.
 3  Spaghetti: Works but tangled. Functions do too many things.
    Copy-paste duplication. Global state.
 4  Rough: Some structure but inconsistent. Mix of patterns.
    Long functions with unclear responsibilities.
 5  Adequate: Reasonable structure. Functions mostly do one thing.
    Some duplication. Naming is okay but not great.
 6  Clean: Clear structure, good naming, minimal duplication.
    Follows existing codebase patterns.
 7  Good: Well-organized with clear interfaces. Easy to read.
    Follows language idioms. Tests are clear.
 8  Strong: Clean abstractions, good separation of concerns.
    Code reads like documentation. Easy to modify.
 9  Excellent: Elegant and simple. Minimal surface area.
    Another developer could maintain this easily.
10  Exemplary: Could be used as a teaching example. Every
    abstraction earns its complexity.
