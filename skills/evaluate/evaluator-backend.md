# Backend Domain Evaluator Template

For Go API-focused backend tasks. Evaluates correctness, API contract fidelity, error handling, and spec fidelity against a running server.

## Runtime Interaction

The evaluator works against a running backend API. All evidence must come
from observing the live server, not from reading source code alone.

### Launch

The server is started by `start-runtimes.sh` before evaluation begins. The evaluator
receives runtime state including:

- **port** — the local port the server is listening on
- **domain** — which domain evaluator to use (in this case, `backend`)

Do not attempt to start or restart the server. If the server is not running, score
Correctness as 1 and note the failure.

### MCP Tools

Use whichever tools are available for the runtime:

- **Go apps:** `go-dev-mcp` — inspect Go-specific details, run tests, check build status.
- **HTTP verification:** `curl` — make HTTP requests, verify status codes, response shapes,
  headers, and error responses.

Prefer HTTP-based evidence for contract and error dimensions.
Prefer tool-based inspection for correctness and build health.

### Evidence Gathering

- Hit all API endpoints with valid and invalid inputs
- Verify response status codes, shapes, and headers
- Test authentication/authorization if applicable
- Check error responses for proper format and messages
- Verify database state changes if applicable
- Test concurrent requests if the API claims concurrency safety
- Record which endpoints were tested and their outcomes

### What to Check

- Does the server start and respond on the expected port?
- Do endpoints return correct status codes?
- Are response shapes consistent with the API contract?
- Do validation errors reference specific fields?
- Are error responses structured and actionable?
- Does the server handle concurrent requests safely?

## Dimensions

### Correctness

Does the code produce right results for all inputs?

**Default threshold: 7**

```
 1  Broken: Doesn't compile or start. Panics on launch.
 2  Crashes: Starts but crashes on basic operations. Core paths broken.
 3  Happy path only: Main flow works, all error paths crash or
    return wrong data.
 4  Fragile: Works for expected inputs. Unexpected inputs cause
    silent corruption, panics, or wrong results.
 5  Partial: Most paths handled. Some edge cases produce wrong
    results. Error messages misleading.
 6  Functional: All specified paths work correctly. Edge cases
    handled but some return generic errors.
 7  Solid: All paths correct with appropriate errors. Input
    validation present. No silent failures.
 8  Robust: Handles unexpected inputs gracefully. Errors are
    specific and actionable. Concurrent access safe.
 9  Thorough: All edge cases handled correctly. Error recovery
    works. Observability (logging, metrics) in place.
10  Bulletproof: Handles adversarial input. Graceful degradation
    under load. Comprehensive observability.
```

### API Contract Fidelity

Does the implementation match the API spec/contract?

**Default threshold: 7**

```
 1  No contract: No spec, endpoints return arbitrary shapes.
 2  Wrong contract: Spec exists but implementation contradicts it.
 3  Partial match: Some endpoints match spec, others diverge
    in structure or status codes.
 4  Structure matches, semantics don't: JSON shapes correct but
    values wrong (wrong units, missing nullability).
 5  Happy path matches: Success responses match spec. Error
    responses are ad-hoc.
 6  Mostly compliant: All responses structurally correct. Some
    status codes wrong (200 instead of 201, 400 instead of 422).
 7  Compliant: All status codes, response shapes, and headers
    match spec. Pagination/filtering works as documented.
 8  Strict compliance: Content types, validation errors, and
    edge case responses all match spec. Undocumented fields absent.
 9  Verified compliance: Contract tests exist and pass.
    Spec and implementation provably in sync.
10  Self-documenting: Generated docs from implementation match
    spec exactly. Breaking changes detected automatically.
```

### Error Handling

How gracefully does the system handle failures?

**Default threshold: 7**

```
 1  No handling: Panics and stack traces leak to client.
 2  Catch-all: Generic 500 for all errors. No differentiation.
 3  Basic: Some errors caught, some leak. Inconsistent format.
 4  Structured but wrong: Error format consistent but status
    codes inappropriate or messages misleading.
 5  Adequate: Errors categorized (4xx vs 5xx). Messages exist
    but are generic ("something went wrong").
 6  Informative: Specific error messages. Correct status codes.
    Client can distinguish error types.
 7  Actionable: Messages tell client what to fix. Validation
    errors reference specific fields.
 8  Complete: All error paths return structured, documented
    errors. Retry-after headers where appropriate.
 9  Graceful: Partial failures handled (some items succeed,
    some fail). Transactional consistency maintained.
10  Resilient: Circuit breakers, fallbacks, degraded modes.
    Errors don't cascade across services.
```

### Domain Spec Fidelity

Does this task's implementation match the task-level spec?

**Default threshold: 8**

```
 1  Wrong feature: Built something entirely different from task spec.
 2  Wrong approach: Right feature, fundamentally wrong implementation strategy.
 3  Major gaps: Core task requirements missing. What exists may be correct
    but the task is incomplete.
 4  Partial: ~50% of task requirements implemented. Missing pieces noticeable.
 5  Most there: ~70% of task requirements. Missing pieces are secondary
    but a careful reviewer would catch them.
 6  Functional coverage: All primary task requirements met. Secondary requirements
    (edge cases, error states, responsive behavior) partially covered.
 7  Good coverage: All task requirements met. Some implemented minimally
    (letter of the spec, not spirit).
 8  Faithful: Implementation matches task spec in both letter and spirit.
    Design intent preserved.
 9  Complete: Every task requirement fully implemented. No drift.
    Implementation captures nuances of the task description.
10  Exceeds spec: All requirements met and implementation improves on
    spec where the task description was ambiguous or underspecified.
