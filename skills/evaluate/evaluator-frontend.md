# Frontend Domain Evaluator Template

For Flutter and web frontend tasks. Evaluates visual output, craft, interactivity, and spec fidelity against a running app.

## Runtime Interaction

The evaluator works against a running frontend application. All evidence must come
from observing the live app, not from reading source code alone.

### Launch

The app is started by `start-runtimes.sh` before evaluation begins. The evaluator
receives runtime state including:

- **port** — the local port the app is served on
- **domain** — which domain evaluator to use (in this case, `frontend`)

Do not attempt to start or restart the app. If the app is not running, score
Visual Quality as 1 and note the failure.

### MCP Tools

Use whichever tools are available for the runtime:

- **Flutter apps:** `marionette` — navigate between screens, tap buttons, scroll
  lists, enter text, and take screenshots of current state.
- **Web apps:** `curl` — make HTTP requests, fetch rendered pages, check status
  codes and response bodies.

Prefer screenshot-based evidence for visual dimensions (Visual Quality, Craft).
Prefer interaction-based evidence for behavioral dimensions (Functionality).

### Evidence Gathering

- Take screenshots of key screens and states
- Exercise primary interactions (navigation, forms, buttons)
- Check visual consistency across multiple states and screens
- Verify responsive behavior if applicable (resize, orientation)
- Test error states (offline, invalid input, empty data)
- Record which interactions were tested and their outcomes

### What to Check

- Does the app render correctly on launch?
- Do interactions produce expected results?
- Are transitions and animations smooth?
- Is the design system applied consistently across screens?
- Do error states show appropriate feedback?
- Are loading states visible during async operations?

## Dimensions

### Visual Quality

Does the rendered output look intentional and polished?

**Default threshold: 7**

```
 1  Broken: App doesn't render. Blank screen, crash, or error state.
 2  Non-functional: Something renders but is unusable. Layout completely
    broken, elements overlapping or off-screen.
 3  Placeholder: Default framework output. Colored rectangles, system
    fonts, no evidence of design system.
 4  Minimal: Some custom styling attempted but inconsistent. Mix of
    placeholder and styled elements. Looks unfinished.
 5  Mediocre: Design system partially applied. Some components styled,
    others default. An engineer's "it works" not a designer's "it's ready."
 6  Acceptable: Design system applied consistently. Custom components
    throughout. Rough edges visible but overall looks intentional.
 7  Good: Matches design reference in structure and feel. Minor polish
    issues. A designer would say "needs a pass" not "start over."
 8  Strong: Close to design reference. Consistent visual language.
    Details mostly right. Minor nitpicks only.
 9  Polished: Matches design reference closely. Smooth transitions,
    proper spacing, color harmony. Ready to ship.
10  Exceptional: Exceeds design reference. Delightful details,
    micro-interactions, visual surprise. Better than specified.
```

### Craft

Typography, spacing, color harmony, contrast, alignment.

**Default threshold: 7**

```
 1  Broken: No text visible, or text unreadable (white on white, 0px font).
 2  Illegible: Text renders but wrong size, overlapping, or truncated.
    Colors clash. No spacing system.
 3  System defaults: Framework default fonts, spacing, colors.
    No intentional typographic choices.
 4  Inconsistent: Some intentional choices but applied unevenly.
    Multiple font sizes with no hierarchy. Spacing varies randomly.
 5  Basic: One font applied. Some spacing consistency. Colors from a
    palette but without harmony. Alignment mostly correct.
 6  Competent: Type hierarchy clear (headings, body, labels). Spacing
    system visible. Colors harmonious. Minor alignment issues.
 7  Good: Type hierarchy, spacing, and color all feel designed together.
    Contrast ratios adequate. Alignment consistent.
 8  Strong: Typography reinforces hierarchy and mood. Spacing creates
    rhythm. Color usage purposeful. No orphaned elements.
 9  Refined: Typographic details polished (line height, letter spacing,
    font weight variation). White space used intentionally.
10  Masterful: Typography, color, and spacing create a distinctive
    visual identity. Every detail considered.
```

### Functionality

Does it work when you use it? Interactive behavior correct?

**Default threshold: 8**

```
 1  Broken: Core interaction doesn't work. Buttons don't respond, pages don't load.
 2  Crashes: Some interactions work, others crash the app.
 3  Partial: Main flow works. Secondary interactions broken or missing.
 4  Fragile: Works for expected interactions. Unexpected actions (back button,
    rapid taps, resize) cause breakage.
 5  Basic: All specified interactions work. No feedback for loading states,
    errors, or edge cases.
 6  Functional: Interactions work with appropriate feedback. Loading states
    shown. Some edge cases unhandled.
 7  Solid: All interactions work correctly with feedback. Error states
    handled. Responsive to different viewport sizes.
 8  Robust: Handles rapid interaction, concurrent state changes, connectivity
    issues. Animations smooth. No jank.
 9  Polished: Transitions between states feel natural. Undo/recovery
    available. Accessibility basics met.
10  Delightful: Interactions feel instant. Animations guide attention.
    Keyboard navigation works. Screen reader compatible.
```

### Domain Spec Fidelity

Does this task's implementation match the task-level spec?

**Default threshold: 8**

```
 1  Wrong feature: Built something entirely different from task spec.
 2  Wrong approach: Right feature, fundamentally wrong implementation strategy.
 3  Major gaps: Core task requirements missing. What exists may be correct
    but the task is incomplete.
 4  Partial: ~50% of task requirements implemented. Missing pieces noticeable.
 5  Most there: ~70% of task requirements. Missing pieces are secondary
    but a careful reviewer would catch them.
 6  Functional coverage: All primary task requirements met. Secondary requirements
    (edge cases, error states, responsive behavior) partially covered.
 7  Good coverage: All task requirements met. Some implemented minimally
    (letter of the spec, not spirit).
 8  Faithful: Implementation matches task spec in both letter and spirit.
    Design intent preserved.
 9  Complete: Every task requirement fully implemented. No drift.
    Implementation captures nuances of the task description.
10  Exceeds spec: All requirements met and implementation improves on
    spec where the task description was ambiguous or underspecified.
```
