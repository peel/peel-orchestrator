# Init

Initialize a project for use with fiddle.

## Process

Run the init script:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/init.sh" .
```

The script:
- Copies doc templates from `.docs/` to `docs/` (skips if docs/ already has content)
- Copies `orchestrate.json` (skips if it exists)
- Runs `beans init` with prefix derived from directory name (skips if `.beans.yml` exists)

Report what was created vs what already existed based on script output.

Suggest next steps:
```
"Project docs are in docs/. Start by filling in:
- docs/product/VISION.md — what you're building, who for, and why
- docs/technical/SYSTEM.md — how the project works today

Then run /fiddle:discover-docs to review gaps and fill in the rest.
Edit orchestrate.json to customize evaluator domains.
When ready: /fiddle:orchestrate <topic>"
```

## Rules

- Idempotent — re-running skips already-initialized components.
- Never overwrite existing files.
