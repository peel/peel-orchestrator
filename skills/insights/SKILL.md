# Insights

Synthesize structured feedback into reusable personas and insight summaries.

ARGUMENTS: {ARGS}

## Configuration

Parse from `{ARGS}`:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--personas-only` | false | Only update personas, skip insight synthesis |
| `--insights-only` | false | Only produce insight summary, skip persona updates |

## Outputs

| Artifact | Path | Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|
| Persona files | `docs/product/personas/<persona-slug>.md` | Created once, updated as feedback accumulates |
| Insight summary | `docs/product/insights/YYYY-MM-DD-synthesis.md` | New file each synthesis cycle |

Create directories if they do not exist.

## Process

### Step 1: Read Feedback

Read all entries from `docs/product/FEEDBACK.md`. Entries follow the structured format defined by `fiddle:feedback` — each entry has Who, Context, Observation, Implication, Confidence, and Tags fields. If the file does not exist or has no entries, stop: "No feedback entries to synthesize."

### Step 2: Update Personas

Skip if `--insights-only`.

Scan feedback entries for recurring actors. Two entries describe the same persona when they share role + segment (e.g., "Senior developer at a fintech company" appearing twice).

For each identified persona, check if a file already exists in `docs/product/personas/`. If it does, update it. If not, create it. Slug is derived from role + segment (e.g., `senior-fintech-dev`). If two different people map to the same slug, append a disambiguator (e.g., `solo-founder-2`).

**Merging vs splitting:** If a persona's context changes over time (e.g., a solo founder hires a team), update the existing persona file — don't create a new one. The Trajectory section captures this evolution. Only split into a new persona if the role + segment genuinely diverge (e.g., they moved from a startup to an enterprise).

#### Persona File Format

```markdown
---
slug: <persona-slug>
role: <role description>
segment: <company type or context>
---

# <Persona Label> (e.g., "Fintech Senior Dev")

## Profile
- **Role:** <role and experience level>
- **Segment:** <company type, size, context>
- **First seen:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Last seen:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Entries:** <count of feedback entries from this persona>

## Trajectory
<2-3 sentences on how this persona's experience has evolved across feedback entries. What did they try? What worked? What didn't?>

## Needs
- <Need derived from their feedback — one bullet per distinct need>

## Risk
<One sentence: churn risk, satisfaction level, or engagement trajectory>
```

**Rules:**
- Update Last seen, Entries count, Trajectory, Needs, and Risk on each synthesis.
- Don't remove needs that previous syntheses identified unless feedback contradicts them.
- Keep Trajectory factual — reference specific feedback dates and observations.

### Step 3: Synthesize Insights

Skip if `--personas-only`.

Read:
- All feedback entries from `docs/product/FEEDBACK.md`
- All persona files from `docs/product/personas/` (if they exist)
- Product docs if they exist: `docs/product/VISION.md`, `docs/product/MARKET.md`, `docs/product/GTM.md`
- Previous insight summaries from `docs/product/insights/` (most recent, if any)

#### Insight Summary Format

```markdown
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
feedback_count: <number of entries synthesized>
previous_synthesis: <path to previous summary, or "none">
---

# Feedback Synthesis — YYYY-MM-DD

## Themes

### <Theme Title>
**Signal strength:** <strong|moderate|weak> — <N entries, N personas> (strong: 3+ entries or 2+ personas; moderate: 2 entries or repeat persona; weak: single entry, single persona)
**Entries:** YYYY-MM-DD "<observation title>", YYYY-MM-DD "<observation title>"
**Pattern:** <What's happening across these entries>
**Implication:** <What this means for the product>
**Alignment:** <How this aligns with or contradicts VISION.md/MARKET.md — write "no product docs available" if they don't exist or are empty templates>

### <Theme Title>
...

## New vs Recurring

- **New themes this cycle:** <list>
- **Recurring from previous synthesis:** <list with trend direction — growing, stable, declining>
- **Resolved since last synthesis:** <list — themes present before that no longer appear>

## Priority Actions

| Priority | Action | Theme | Impact | Personas Affected |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | <concrete action> | <theme> | <what improves> | <which personas> |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Open Questions

- <Questions this feedback raises but doesn't answer — useful for brainstorm sessions>
```

**Rules:**
- Cross-reference with product docs to check alignment. If VISION says "target enterprise teams" but all friction feedback comes from solo founders, flag the mismatch.
- Compare with previous synthesis if one exists. Are themes growing, stable, or declining?
- Priority actions should be concrete enough to become backlog items or bean descriptions.
- Keep the summary under 200 lines. This will be loaded as context during planning.

### Step 4: Present and Confirm

Present a summary of what was produced:
```
"Insights synthesis complete:
- Personas updated: [list with paths]
- Insight summary: [path]

[Brief highlight: top theme, top priority action, any product alignment concerns]

Review and confirm?"
```

Wait for user confirmation before writing files.

## How Insights Are Consumed

Discover and brainstorm phases load these artifacts automatically when they exist:
- **Discover phase:** Personas and latest insight summary inform scope decisions
- **Brainstorm phase:** Insight themes and persona needs inform approach selection and design tradeoffs

This is the compound loop: Feedback → Insights → Planning → Features → Feedback.
